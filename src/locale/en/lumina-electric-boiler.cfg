[mod-setting-description]
lumina-electric-boiler-basic-power=The power consumption of a standard boiler with a speed of 1. Other boilers speeds will be based off of the ratio to this number.
lumina-electric-boiler-fluid-amount=The amount of fluid consumed (water) and produced (steam) in a single cycle. Lower values produce less steam but operate faster at the same power requirement. All crafting times are based off of this number and the base power consumption.
lumina-electric-boiler-tiers=Number of tiers of electric boiler available and created by this mod. Power usage is linear with tier. Can be set to 0 to not create any boilers and use this mod as an API only. Recipes and technologies are provided for up to 3 tiers.
lumina-electric-boiler-auto-generate-temperatures=Generate possible temperatures based on available boilers / heat exchangers.
lumina-electric-boiler-extra-temperatures=Comma-separated list of additional temperatures to generate. Useful to set available temperatures if auto-generation is disabled.
lumina-electric-boiler-priority=Decided when and how much power should be consumed by the electric boilers. If you don't know what this is, best not to change it. The default is "tertiary", which allows boilers to consume any excess electric production but no more.

[technology-description]
lumina-electric-boilers-electric-boilers=Electric boilers can turn water into steam of varying temperatures with electricity. Imperfect efficiency may result in some energy loss.

lumina-electric-boiler-priority-primary-input=Highest priority consumer, on par with laser turrets
lumina-electric-boiler-priority-secondary-input=Normal priority consumer, on par with most machines
lumina-electric-boiler-priority-tertiary=Low priority consumer, on par with most accumulators
